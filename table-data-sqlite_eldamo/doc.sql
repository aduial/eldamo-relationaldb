Additional rules can be deduced by examining the phonetic developments in the <i>Etymologies</i> of the 1930s (LR/341-400), which are largely but not completely compatible with the changes described in the <i>Comparative Tables</i>.</p><p>In the <i>Comparative Tables</i>, Tolkien first said that Ilkorin was of a “Germanic type” (PE19/22 note #54) as was the case for the phonology of <a href="../language-pages/lang-eilk.html">Early Ilkorin</a>, but Tolkien later rejected this change, presumably after he revised the tables. He then said that “Doriath[rin] etc. = Noldorin (viz. as it used to be)”, which Christopher Gilson suggested meant that it adopted the Welsh-like phonology of earlier <a href="../language-pages/lang-g.html">Gnomish and Early Noldorin</a> (PE19/22 note #56). Thus, comparison to Welsh can provide additional clues to Ilkorin phonology.</p><p>For my analysis of the phonology of Ilkorin and Doriathrin, I frequently consulted Helge Fauskanger’s work on these languages from his <i>Ardalambion</i> web site (<a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ilkorin.htm">AL-Ilkorin</a>, <a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/doriath.htm">AL-Doriathrin</a>). Most of the Ilkorin phonetic rules in this lexicon agreed with Mr. Fauskanger’s analysis, but his work predates the publication of the <i>Comparative Tables</i> and TQ2. There are few cases where I was able to describe certain sound changes in more detail because I had access to more information, but in almost all cases I found Mr. Fauskanger’s analysis remains valid.</p>', 1004);

This lexicon incorporates the few words specifically assigned to that dialect in this section.

Some of the more mysterious sound changes in the <i>Etymologies</i> can be explained by comparison to the real-world Proto-Germanic, Old English and Old Norse languages, such as the apparent phenomenon of <a l="dan" v="[a], [e], [i] broke into diphthongs before [l], [r] clusters">vowel breaking</a>. Such comparisons must be done carefully, however. For example, Danian show little evidence of the famous sound changes from Grimm’s Law: the only parallel is the <a l="dan" v="initial [p] became [pʰ]">change of initial [p] to [f]</a>. Compare this to the <a href="phonetics-eilk.html">phonology of Early Ilkorin</a> where the operation of Grimm’s Law is clear.</p><p>As I did with Ilkorin and Doriathrin, I consulted Helge Fauskanger’s work on the Danian and Nandorin languages from his <i>Ardalambion</i> web site (<a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/nandorin.htm">AL-Nandorin</a>), which as far as I know is the only other attempt to analyze Danian. Unfortunately, Mr. Fauskanger’s analysis predates the publication of the <i>Comparative Tables</i> in PE19, and he was missing the all-important clue that Danian/Ossiriandic was inspired by Old English. As such, while he able to recognize such phenomenom as vowel-breaking, his analysis was limited because he did not know which real-world languages to compare it to. Using that additional piece of information, I was able to deduce a number of patterns of sound change not appearing in Mr. Fauskanger’s article. Nevertheless, given the lack of evidence, my work here can only be described as slightly-better-informed educated guesses on the development of Danian.</p><p>@@@ For comparison to Proto-Germanic, Old English and Old Norse, I mostly used the information from articles related to those languages in Wikipedia.

PE18 also contains an article on pre-Fëanorian alphabets from the 1920s, a continuation of the first article on this topic from PE16.</p><p>The second version of the <i>Tengwesta Qenderinwa</i> (TQ2) still predates Tolkien’s reorganization of the Elvish languages into Quenya and Sindarin, though early evidence of this change appear in the document, such as the name <i>Sindarin</i> for the Elves of Beleriand.

This tale was a companion to two other related documents, the story “The Notion Club Papers” (SD/145-327) and “Lowdham’s Report on the Adunaic Language” (SD/413-440), the latter being a partial description of the phonetics and grammar of Adûnaic. These works were composed in the mid-1940s, during various breaks J.R.R. Tolkien took from working on <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.</p><p>As suggested by Andreas Moehn (<a ref="LGtAG"/>), Adunaic went through three phases of conceptual development, which he labeled k-Adûnaic, d-Adûnaic and a-Adûnaic (after three distinct words for “Earth” in each phase: <i><a l="ad" v="kamāt"/></i>, <i><a l="ad" v="dâira"/></i> and <i><a l="ad" v="aban"/></i>). This lexicon labels the phases: Draft Adûnaic, Middle Adûnaic and Late Adûnaic.</p><p>The first phase, Draft Adûnaic, is reflected in the drafts of the three works mentioned above. In this phase, Adûnaic was a European-like inflected language with five noun cases (Normal, Subjective, Genitive, Dative and Instrumental). Christopher Tolkien published some fragments of grammar from this phase (SD/438-439), and more information can be gleaned from Adûnaic words and phrases appearing the drafts of the two stories.</p><p>As J.R.R. Tolkien revised the stories, he made dramatic changes to its grammar. The final versions of the 1940s stories reflect this Middle Adûnaic phase, in which the “Semitic” character of the language emerged (SD/415). This was likely due to the influence of Dwarvish on Adûnaic (SD/414), which Tolkien also described as “Semitic” in nature (PE17/85). The noun case system was simplified (to Normal, Subjective and Objective cases) and made rather non-European in its use. Changes to the verb system are harder to analyze, since verb conjugation was not fully described.</p><p>The bulk of the information on Middle Adunaic grammar comes from Lowdham’s Report, which details the phonetic development of Adûnaic and most of its noun declensions. It was abandoned before Tolkien described other parts of speech, with only a few notes on verbs remaining (SD/439). In “The Notion Club Papers”, there is a lengthy text (SD/246-7) referred to by this lexicon as the <a l="ad" v="Lament of Akallabêth"/>. Draft versions of the Lament also exist (SD/311-2), and comparing the draft to finished forms of the Lament gives useful insights to the conceptual changes from Draft to Middle Adûnaic. Andreas Moehn wrote a detailed analysis of these changes (<a ref="LGtAG"/>).</p><p>Christopher Tolkien stated that his father did no further work on Adûnaic after setting aside Lowdham’s Report (SD/439). However, (as pointed out by Andreas Moehn, <a ref="LGtAG"/>), J.R.R. Tolkien’s later Adûnaic examples are not entirely consistent with Adûnaic as described in Lowdham’s Report. There are enough differences in later Adûnaic names and words in the published <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>Silmarillion</i> to believe there was some further conceptual development in Adûnaic, which this lexicon collectively labels Late Adûnaic.</p><p>Draft and Middle Adûnaic were contemporaneous with <a href="../language-pages/lang-mq.html">Middle Quenya</a> and <a href="../language-pages/lang-n.html">Noldorin</a>, while Late Adûnaic was contemporaneous with <a href="../language-pages/lang-q.html">Late Quenya</a> and <a href="../language-pages/lang-s.html">Sindarin</a>.

See the entry on <a l="ad" v="conceptual-changes-in-late-Adûnaic"/> for the details.</p><p>Rather than separating the conceptual phases into different languages as this lexicon does for Quenya and Sindarin, it lumps all of them together as “Adûnaic”. Furthermore, almost everything we can say about Adûnaic grammar is from the Middle Adûnaic as described in Lowdham’s Report. This was not Tolkien final vision of the language, but it is the best we can do with the information available.

The different ways of forming the genitive can have subtle differences in meaning: “soldier’s king”, “soldier king”, and “king of soldiers” have different connations, each describing different kinds of genitive relationships: possessive-genitive, adjectival-genitive, composition-genitive, and so forth.</p><p>Like English, Adûnaic has several ways of expressing genitive relationships (SD/428-9, 435).

This hints that the Dwarvish influence was later than that of the Avari, but we don’t have enough information about either Adûnaic or Khuzdul to examine this relationship in detail.

Conversely, in the later sentences the subject is inflected into the subjective case while the predicate is uninflected. This demonstrates the functional shift in the use of the predicate suffix <i>-n</i> in these drafts to the later use of the subjective inflection.</p><p>In both the second draft and final typescript versions of the Lament, the form <i>îdôn</i> was retained in all the sentences where it appeared in the first draft. This means that it could have been a remnant of this earlier syntax.

In the narrative frame of the first stanza, the geminate forms describe events that had already happened before the fall: Sauron had already come to Númenor (S1), Ar-Pharazôn had already begun his war against the Valar (S3). Similarly the syncopated forms describe events occurring at the moment of the fall: the Valar breaking the world (S4) and the seas filling the chasm left by the destruction (S5). In this context, the geminate forms make more sense as pluperfects.</p><p>In the second stanza, the geminate form describes the world’s state before the fall of Númenor: there was (once) a straight road to Valinor (S11). It is followed immediately by sentence describing the world’s state after the exile: <i><a l="ad" v="îdô katha batîna lôkhî"/></i> “now all ways (are) bent” [around the now-round Earth] (S12). Again, the geminate form works better as the pluperfect.</p><p>The sentences where Tolkien vacillated between forms (S2, S6) could make sense as either a pluperfect or not. The Númenóreans’ fall under shadow (S2) could be a pluperfect with respect to fall of Númenor, or it could be within the same time frame if it is considered the proximate cause of Númenor’s destruction. The fall of Númenor itself (S6) lies between the first and second stanza: it could be a pluperfect from the perspective of the second stanza (happening before the exile) or within the same time frame if it is  part of the first stanza. I treat the change of <i>azagrāra</i> &gt;&gt; <i>azaggara</i> (S3) as a special case, discussed separately in the entry on the <a l="ad" v="continuative-past"/>.</p><p>If the roles of the aorist and past verb forms are reversed, the narrative flow breaks down. Therefore, it makes more sense that the geminate form is the past tense, used as a pluperfect throughout the Lament.</p><p class="entry-section">Other Theories</p><p>Carl Hostetter and Patrick Wynne suggested (<a ref="VSH"/>/27-29) that the geminate forms are the <a l="ad" v="continuative-past"/>. They base their argument on the gloss of <i>azaggara</i> “was warring” in the final version of the Lament. This gloss indicates this particular verb was in the continuative past, and they conclude that similar geminate forms belong to the same tense. As further evidence for their idea, they point out that Primitive Elvish sometimes used geminate forms to indicate a frequentative function (for example ᴹ✶<i><a l="mp" v="battā́"/></i>, Ety/BAT).</p><p>While this works for <i>azaggara</i>, it doesn’t work well for the other geminate forms, which all glossed with the past tense. I personally believe the opposite happened: when Tolkien changed <i>azagrāra</i> (second draft) &gt;&gt; <i>azaggara</i> (final draft) he changed it from the continuative-past to the ordinary past tense functioning as a pluperfect, but for some reason neglected to revise its gloss. Omitting the special case of <i>azaggara</i>, the remaining geminate forms in the Lament work better as pluperfects, as argued above.</p><p>Aside from Hostetter and Wynne, there is a general consensus in the literature that the geminate forms are the Adûnaic past tense (<a ref="AL"/>/Adûnaic, <a ref="LGtAG"/>, <a ref="NBA"/>/26), although there is considerable disagreement on the exact status of <i>azaggara</i>.</p><p class="entry-section">Draft Verb Conjugations</p><p>There are several geminate (double-consonant) forms in the first draft version of the <i><a l="ad" v="Lament of Akallabêth (first draft)">Lament of Akallabêth</a></i>: <i>unekkū</i> “he-came”, <i>rakkhatū</i> “broke asunder” and <i>phurrusim</i> “flow” (plural).

It is evidently a combination of the noun <i><a l="ad" v="pharaz"/></i> “gold” with an adjective creation suffix <i><a l="ad" v="-ôn"/></i>, and if syncopated would be **<i>Pharzôn</i>. Perhaps this particular suffix is exempt from the rule, or suffixes that form adjectives from nouns are generally exempt.</li><li><i>nuphrât</i> “mother and father” (SD/434): Tolkien gives this as the dual form of <i><a l="ad" v="nuphâr"/></i> “parent”.

The diphthongs <i>êi</i> and <i>ôu</i> existed archaically, but were modified in this way by the time of Classical Adûnaic. For example, <i><a l="ad" v="izrê"/></i> “sweetheart, beloved” with the plural inflection <i><a l="ad" v="-î-"/></i> becomes <i>izrê</i> and <i><a l="ad" v="manô"/></i> “spirit” with the objective inflection <i><a l="ad" v="-u-"/></i> becomes <i>manô</i> (SD/438).</p><p>5) There is some evidence that long <i>ô</i> and <i>ê</i> absorb a following <i>a</i> as well. When the dual suffix <i><a l="ad" v="-at"/></i> is added to <i><a l="ad" v="manô"/></i> “spirit” and <i><a l="ad" v="izrê"/></i> “sweetheart, beloved”, the result is <i>mânôt</i> and <i>izrêt</i> (SD/438). In archaic language, though, it seems such formations used a <a l="ad" v="glide-consonant"/>.</p><p>6) When an <i>i</i> or <i>u</i> is followed by a different vowel, it is separated from that vowel by a <a l="ad" v="glide-consonant"/> <i>y</i> or <i>w</i>, respectively (SD/434). This applies to the Adûnaic long <a l="ad" v="diphthongs"/> as well, because they all end in an <i>i</i> or <i>u</i>.</p><p>7) It is unclear what would happen with combinations of <i>ê</i> and <i>ô</i>, but my guess is that they would also use glided consonants <i>y</i> or <i>w</i>: *<i>êyô</i>, *<i>êyê</i>; *<i>ôwô</i>, *<i>ôwê</i>. This is consistent with the phonetic developments from the primitive forms of these combinations: ✶[ai] + ✶[au] &gt; [aiyau] &gt; [ēyō].</p><p>It is possible, though, that pairs of <i>ê</i> and <i>ô</i> follow the vowel contraction rule #1 above: <i>ê</i> + <i>ê</i> ⇒ <i>ê</i>; <i>ô</i> + <i>ô</i> ⇒ <i>ô</i>. It depends on whether the Númenóreans perceived <a l="ad" v="[ē]"/> and <a l="ad" v="[ō]"/> as a single sound or as a combination of vowels, similar to how the long English “e” and “o” are sometimes written with two vowels: “ea” as in “read”, “oa” as in “road”. My guess is they are perceived as a combination of sounds and therefore use the glide consonant.</p><p>8) It is also unclear what would happen if a long or short <i>a</i> were combined with a following <i>ê</i> or <i>ô</i>, but I would guess these combinations would develop into the long diphthongs <i>âi</i> and <i>âu</i>. Though not explicitly discussed by Tolkien, these combinations do appear in the chart of apparent gradiations on SD/425 as variations of long <i>ê</i> or <i>ô</i>. This change is consistent with the likely phonetic developments from the primitive forms of these combinations, for example ✶[ā̆] + ✶[au] &gt; [āu]. A long or short <i>a</i> in combination with the diphthongs <i>êu</i> and <i>ôi</i> would therefore produced *<i>âiyu</i> and *<i>âuwi</i>.</p><center><table style="text-align: center"><tr><th colspan="5">Table of Adûnaic Vowel Combinations</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td><i>ā̆</i> + <i>ā̆</i> ⇒ <i>â</i></td><td><i>ī̆</i> + <i>ī̆</i> ⇒ <i>î</i></td><td><i>ū̆</i> + <i>ū̆</i> ⇒ <i>û</i></td><td>✧ SD/424</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><i>a</i> + <i>i</i> ⇒ <i>ê</i></td><td><i>a</i> + <i>u</i> ⇒ <i>ô</i></td><td>&#160;</td><td>✧ SD/423</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" style="vertical-align: middle">3</td><td><i>â</i> + <i>ī̆</i> ⇒ <i>âi</i></td><td><i>a</i> + <i>î</i> ⇒ <i>âi</i></td><td><i>ô</i> + <i>ī̆</i> ⇒ <i>ôi</i></td><td rowspan="2" style="vertical-align: middle">✧ SD/423-4</td></tr><tr><td><i>â</i> + <i>ū̆</i> ⇒ <i>âu</i></td><td><i>a</i> + <i>û</i> ⇒ <i>âu</i></td><td><i>ê</i> + <i>ū̆</i> ⇒ <i>êu</i></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" style="vertical-align: middle">1+3</td><td><i>âi</i> + <i>ī̆</i> ⇒ <i>âi</i></td><td><i>ôi</i> + <i>ī̆</i> ⇒ <i>ôi</i></td><td>&#160;</td><td rowspan="2" style="vertical-align: middle">[1]</td></tr><tr><td><i>âu</i> + <i>ū̆</i> ⇒ <i>âu</i></td><td><i>êu</i> + <i>ū̆</i> ⇒ <i>êu</i></td><td>&#160;</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><i>ê</i> + <i>ī̆</i> ⇒ <i>ê</i></td><td><i>ô</i> + <i>ū̆</i> ⇒ <i>ô</i></td><td>&#160;</td><td>✧ SD/424</td></tr><tr><td>5*</td><td><i>ê</i> + <i>ā̆</i> ⇒ <i>ê</i></td><td><i>ô</i> + <i>ā̆</i> ⇒ <i>ô</i></td><td>&#160;</td><td>[2]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4" style="vertical-align: middle">6</td><td><i>ī̆</i> + <i>ā̆</i> ⇒ <i>ī̆yā̆</i></td><td><i>ī̆</i> + <i>ū̆</i> ⇒ <i>ī̆yū̆</i></td><td>&#160;</td><td rowspan="4" style="vertical-align: middle">✧ SD/434<br/>[3]</td></tr><tr><td><i>ī̆</i> + <i>ê</i> ⇒ <i>ī̆yê</i></td><td><i>ī̆</i> + <i>ô</i> ⇒ <i>ī̆yô</i></td><td>&#160;</td></tr><tr><td><i>ū̆</i> + <i>ā̆</i> ⇒ <i>ū̆wā̆</i></td><td><i>ū̆</i> + <i>ī̆</i> ⇒ <i>ū̆wī̆</i></td><td>&#160;</td></tr><tr><td><i>ū̆</i> + <i>ê</i> ⇒ <i>ū̆wê</i></td><td><i>ū̆</i> + <i>ô</i> ⇒ <i>ū̆wô</i></td><td>&#160;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" style="vertical-align: middle">7?</td><td><i>ê</i> + <i>ê</i> ⇒ *<i>êyê</i></td><td><i>ê</i> + <i>ô</i> ⇒ *<i>êyô</i></td><td>&#160;</td><td rowspan="2" style="vertical-align: middle">[4]</td></tr><tr><td><i>ô</i> + <i>ê</i> ⇒ *<i>ôwê</i></td><td><i>ô</i> + <i>ô</i> ⇒ *<i>ôwô</i></td><td>&#160;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" style="vertical-align: middle">8?</td><td><i>ā̆</i> + <i>ê</i> ⇒ *<i>âi</i></td><td><i>ā̆</i> + <i>ô</i> ⇒ *<i>âu</i></td><td>&#160;</td><td rowspan="2" style="vertical-align: middle">[4]</td></tr><tr><td><i>ā̆</i> + <i>êu</i> ⇒ *<i>âiyu</i></td><td><i>ā̆</i> + <i>ôi</i> ⇒ *<i>âuwi</i></td><td>&#160;</td></tr></table></center><p>In the table above, vowels with a circumflex are long (<i>â</i>), unmarked vowels are short (<i>a</i>), and vowels with both a breve and a macron can be either short or long (<i>ā̆</i>), with their length preserved if they also appear in the result.

The remaining declensions can be deduced from the suffixes of the Weak I noun declensions and the rules for Adûnaic <a l="ad" v="vowel-combinations"/>. These speculative declensions are marked with an asterisk (*) in the table above.</p><p>[2] The word <i>karbî</i> “mare” is the feminine form of <i><a l="ad" v="karab"/></i> “horse” (SD/434).</p><p>[3] As noted above, gendered Weak I nouns use the appropriate gendered subjective suffix: <i><a l="ad" v="-an"/></i> (common), <i><a l="ad" v="-in"/></i> (feminine) and <i><a l="ad" v="-un"/></i>: <i><a l="ad" v="kathuphazgân"/></i> “conqueror” (masculine) → <i>kathuphazgânun</i> (SD/429), <i><a l="ad" v="banâth"/></i> “wife” (feminine) → <i>banâthin</i> (SD/437). The subjective suffix can also be used to indicate the gender of an otherwise common noun: <i><a l="ad" v="nûph"/></i> “fool” → <i>nûphan</i> (unspecified), <i>nûphin</i> (feminine), <i>nûphun</i> (masculine) (SD/438).</p><p>[4] Gendered Weak II nouns reduce the subjective suffix to <i>-n</i> in all cases.</p><p>[5] In Classical Adûnaic, feminine nouns often replace the usual objective inflection <i><a l="ad" v="-u-"/></i> with the vowel <i>i</i> instead (SD/432). For Weak I nouns, the result is: <i><a l="ad" v="mîth"/></i> “baby girl” → (objective) <i>mîthi</i> instead of <i>mîthu</i>.</p><p>[6] The feminine objective inflection <i>-i-</i> is absorbed into Weak II nouns ending in <i>-ê</i> and <i>-î</i>, so that the objective and normal singular forms are identical in such cases. Archaically, the objective was formed with the general objective suffix <i>-u</i> and a <a l="ad" v="glide-consonant"/> <i>y</i>: <i>-ê</i> → †<i>-ayu</i> (or <i>-âyu</i>?) and <i>-î</i> → †<i>-îyu</i>.</p><p>[7] The objective inflection <i>-u-</i> is absorbed into masculine Weak II nouns ending in <i>-ô</i> and <i>-û</i>, so that the objective and normal singular forms are identical in such cases. Unlike the feminine Weak II nouns, there was no archaic glide-consonant form, since the primitive suffixal ✶<i>-u</i> was the same as the final vowel of the primitive endings ✶<i>-au</i> or ✶<i>-ū</i> and was thus absorbed even archaically.</p><p>[8] For duals of Weak II nouns ending in <i>-â</i>, <i>-ê</i> or <i>-ô</i>, the vowel of the dual suffix <i><a l="ad" v="-at"/></i> is absorbed, leaving only <i>-t</i>. Archaically, however, the final <i>-ê</i> and <i>-ô</i> instead decomposed into †<i>-ay</i> and †<i>-aw</i> before the dual <i>-at</i>, as discussed in the entry on the <a l="ad" v="glide-consonant"/>.</p><p>[9] For duals of Weak II nouns ending in <i>-î</i> or <i>-û</i>, the vowel of the dual suffix <i><a l="ad" v="-at"/></i> is separated from the noun’s final vowel by the usual <a l="ad" v="glide-consonant"/>, <i>y</i> or <i>w</i>.</p><p>[10] For subjective duals, wherever the normal dual form has a short <i>a</i>, it is lengthened to long <i>â</i> in the subjective case via the usual a-fortification process.</p><p>[11] For plurals of Weak II nouns ending in <i>-â</i>, <i>-ô</i> or <i>-û</i>, the plural inflection <i><a l="ad" v="-î-"/></i> either forms a long diphthong (with <i>â</i>, <i>ô</i>) or is separated from the final vowel (with <i>û</i>) by the usual <a l="ad" v="glide-consonant"/> <i>w</i>. This is entirely consistent with the standard rules for Adûnaic <a l="ad" v="vowel-combinations"/>.</p><p>[12] For plurals of Weak II nouns ending in <i>-ê</i> or <i>-î</i> (which were feminine), the plural inflection <i><a l="ad" v="-î-"/></i> is absorbed according to the standard rules for Adûnaic <a l="ad" v="vowel-combinations"/>, so that the normal singular and plural forms are identical: <i><a l="ad" v="izrê"/></i> “sweetheart” (singular) and <i>izrê</i> “sweethearts” (plural) (SD/438). Sometimes, though, a <a l="ad" v="linking-consonant"/> <i>n</i> is inserted between the final vowel and the plural suffix <i>-î</i>, to distinguish the singular and plural forms: <i>izrênî</i> “sweethearts” (plural) (SD/438). In the examples given by Tolkien, this only happened with nouns ending in <i>-ê</i>, but the process may have applied to nouns ending in <i>-î</i> as well.</p><p>[13] For all gendered weak nouns, the gendered subjective plural suffix <i><a l="ad" v="-im"/></i> is added to the plural form. In all cases, the vowel <i>i</i> of the suffix is absorbed according to the standard rules for Adûnaic <a l="ad" v="vowel-combinations"/>, leaving only <i>-m</i>.</p>', 1000);

The particular infinitive could also take possessive suffixes as a way of forming passive constructions: <i>mérin cenitalyas (cen-ita-lya-s) anta alassë lyenna</i> “I wish [that] your seeing him gives you joy” (lit. gives joy to you).</p><p>The infinitive was used in imperative expressions, following the imperative particle <i><a l="q" v="á"/></i>, as in <i>á laita (te)</i> “[do] praise (them)”.

In a lengthy essay on the nature of this word (VT41/11-19), Tolkien described it as the source of wisdom and moral impulses that informed one’s judgement, so perhaps the closest English equivalent is “conscience”. This is still not quite right, however, since the <i>órë</i> could be the source of negative impulses as well, particularly of Men (VT41/13). Furthermore, divine powers such as the Valar could sometimes (but not always) communicate subtly through one’s <i>órë</i> (VT41/15).

INSERT INTO DOC (ID, TXT, DOCTYPE_ID) VALUES (2408, '<p>The perfect tense in Quenya indicates an action that has been completed before the present time. In English, the perfect tense is usually expressed with an auxiliary verb, as in “lived” (past) versus “has lived” (perfect) from the verb “to live”. In Quenya, the perfect tense has its own verbal conjugation: <i>marne</i> (past) versus <i>amárië</i> (perfect) from the verb <i><a l="q" v="mar-"/></i> “to abide, *dwell, live”.</p><p>Like English, the Quenya perfect is used when the effects of the completed action are still felt in the present time, as distinct from the past tense, where the action simply occurred at some point in the past. For example, if you said “the man lived in the city”, you only know that at some point in the past the man was in the city. If, however, you say “the man has lived in the city (for many years)”, you imply that he is still living in the city now.</p><p>The conjugation for the Quenya perfect has three markers: (1) a vowel prefix (augment), identical to the base vowel of the verb, (2) a lengthening of the base vowel and (3) the suffix <i>-ië</i> (PE22/96, 131). For example, with the perfect <i>amárië</i> from the verb <i>mar-</i>, the initial <i>a-</i> is the augment that matches the base vowel, the base vowel itself is lengthened to <i>á</i>, and the suffix <i>-ië</i> is added. Similarly, the perfect of <i><a l="q" v="tul-"/></i> “to come” is <i>utúlië</i> “has come” (S/190).</p><p>Of the three markers, only the third, the suffix <i>-ië</i> is absolutely required (PE22/104). The vowel augment is the most optional of the three markers: it can be omitted merely for aesthetic reasons, especially in verse (WJ/366). For example <i>avánië</i> “has gone” (the perfect form of the irregular verb <i><a l="q" v="auta-¹"/></i>) can also appear without its augment as simply <i>vánië</i>. Compare the <i><a l="q" v="Namárië"/></i> poems in the 1st and 2nd editions of the Lord of the Rings, where the <i>vánië</i>/<i>avánië</i> variations took place (RC/341).</p><p>Similarly, the vowel lengthening is prohibited if the base vowel appeared before a pair of consonants, as in the perfect <i>ataltie</i> from the verb <i><a l="q" v="talta-"/></i> (PE17/186). The suffix <i>-ië</i> by itself is not enough to fully distinguish the perfect form, however, because such a conjugation would be identical in form to the verb’s <a l="q" v="gerund"/>. At least one of the other two markers (augment or lengthened base vowel) should be used if at all possible.</p><p><b>Perfects of Verbs Beginning with Vowels:</b> In the case of verbs beginning with vowels, any vowel augment would be absorbed by the base vowel of the verb. For example, the verb <i><a l="q" v="ulya-"/></i> “to pour” would have a (<a l="q" v="strong-perfect">strong</a>) perfect form <i>u-úlië</i>, which simply becomes <i>úlië</i> (PE22/112). Since the vowel augment is optional in any case, verbs beginning with vowels effectively omit the augment.</p><p>Sometimes, however, particularly in poetic writing, the perfects are formed by duplicating the entire stem, as <i>ulúlië</i> (PE22/112) or <i>orórië</i> from <i>orya-</i> (PE22/133, 157). This is not the norm, however.</p><p><b>Perfects of Verbs Beginning with Reduced Consonants:</b> In some cases, the perfect can preserve consonant clusters that were normally reduced at the beginning of words. For example <i><a l="q" v="nac-¹"/></i> “to hew, slay” from the root √<i><a l="p" v="NDAK"/></i> had an (archaic) perfect form <i>andácië</i> (PE22/112, 133). Over time, however, these perfects tend to normalize and become consistent with their other modern verb forms: <i>anácië</i>.</p><p><b>The Perfect and the Past Tenses:</b> In Old Quenya, the conjugations of the perfect and past tenses were independent of one another. Tolkien stated that as time went on, however, “the forms of past and perfect became progressively more closely associated in Quenya” (WJ/366). This meant that the perfect is often formed using the past tense instead of the verb stem.</p><p>For example, the verb <i><a l="q" v="mat-"/></i> has the past tense form <i>mantë</i>. Originally its perfect was formed directly from the verb stem: †<i>amátië</i>. Over time it converged with the past tense, so that its perfect form became <i>amantie</i> (PE22/104). The verb <i><a l="q" v="ista-"/></i> has the irregular past tense <i>(i)sintë</i>, and its perfect became <i>isintië</i> (PE17/77).</p><p>The coalescence of the past and perfect is most common with (a) irregular past tenses and (b) weak verbs. Most weak verbs conjugate their past tense with the simple past suffix <i>-në</i>, and their perfects are usually formed by modifying their past tense forms rather than stem. For example, <i>ehentanie</i> from <i><a l="q" v="henta-"/></i> “to examine” (PE17/77) and <i>etengwanie</i> from <i><a l="q" v="tengwa-"/></i> “to read” (VT49/48).</p><p>The past and perfect forms are one way to distinguish true <a l="q" v="derived-verbs"/> (with verbal suffixes like <i>-ta</i>) from <a l="q" v="TALAT-stem-verbs"/> (from primitive triconsonantal roots). TALAT-stem verbs like <i><a l="q" v="talta-"/></i> can superficially resemble derived verbs, but their past tenses and perfects are different: <i>talantë</i> and †<i>ataltië</i> (later <i>atalantië</i>), as opposed to **<i>taltane</i> and **<i>ataltanie</i>. See the entry on <a l="q" v="TALAT-stem-verbs"/> for further discussion.</p><p>As a general rule, perfects are only formed directly from the stem in the case of regular strong verbs (AKA basic verbs), though of course this is the majority of verb forms.</p><p><b>Conceptual Development:</b> There are a couple of examples that appear to be perfect forms in the earliest <i>Lost Tales</i> from the 1910s: ᴱQ. <i>tulielto</i> “they have come” and <i><a l="eq" v="i·Eldar tulier"/></i> “the Eldar have come” from the verb <i><a l="eq" v="tulu-"/></i> “to come” (LT1/114), as well as <i><a l="eq" v="i·kal’antúlien"/></i> “light hath returned” from the verb <i><a l="eq" v="antulu-"/></i> “to return” (LT1/184). At this earliest stage, these forms are different from the attested Early Quenya <a l="eq" v="past"/> tense forms (which tended to use either either vowel-lengthening or nasal-infixion/suffixion), and are therefore probably genuine perfects. They already had the distinctive <i>-ie</i> suffix of later perfect forms, and possibly vowel-lengthening in the case of <i>antúlien</i>.</p><p>The situation is more complicated in the <i>Early Qenya Grammar</i> of the 1920s, however, where <i>-ie</i> is one of the suffixes used for the past tense, not the perfect (PE14/56). As this stage, the perfect is formed using the past active-participle (<i>-ien(d)-</i>) in combination with an auxiliary verb, but “is” instead of English “has”. Thus: <i><a l="eq" v="e tulien"/></i> “is having come = has come”, or <i>tuliende</i> “has come” with the verb <i>e</i> “is” as a suffix (PE14/57).</p><p>By the 1930s, Tolkien seems to have reverted to <i>-ie</i> as the perfect suffix. There are perfect forms in <i><a l="mq" v="Fíriel’s Song"/></i> from the 1930s: <i>kárielto</i> or <i>kárier</i> “they made” from the verb <i><a l="mq" v="kar-"/></i>, versus its past tense <i>káre</i> (LR/72). There are several perfect forms in the <i><a l="mq" v="Lament of Atalante"/></i>: <i>ullier</i> “poured” (LR/47, SD/247) and <i>lantie(r)</i> “fell” (LR/47, 56). There are also appear to be perfect forms in the <i><a l="mq" v="Namárië, draft"/></i> from <i>Lord of the Rings</i> drafts from the 1940s, such as <i>tūlier</i> (TI/285). At this stage, it seems that the lengthening of the stem vowel (where possible) was also part of the perfect formation.</p><p>The first unambiguous appearance of the perfect-augment was not until very late in the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> drafts with <i>túvien</i> &gt;&gt; <i>utúvienyes</i> “I have found it” (SD/57). In Tolkien’s linguistic writings, the perfect-augment was also mentioned in a discussion of Quenya verb from the late 1940s (PE22/96, 112). It seems likely that when Tolkien wrote <i>vánie</i> “has gone” in the 1st edition version of the <i><a l="q" v="Namárië"/></i> poem <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, that it was in fact a regular perfect form, and Tolkien only decided later than <i>vánië</i> was a poetic variant of the regular augmented <i>avánië</i>.</p><p>The <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> document from the 1940s also discussed an alternate “long perfect” syntax based on the <a l="q" v="perfect-participle"/> (PE22/104), used with derived verbs to be more distinctive from the past tense. It is unclear whether this syntax remained valid in Tolkien’s later writing. See the <a l="q" v="long-perfect"/> for further discussion.</p><p>This same text also mentioned that stem-reduplication for verbs beginning with a vowel (such as <i>ulúlië</i>) was a poetic-only form (PE22/112). In some very late notes towards the end of the 1960s, Tolkien included quite a few example of stem-reduplication, however: <i>isísië</i> and <i>orórië</i> (PE22/159, 164), so perhaps Tolkien considered making such reduplication a more normal part of perfect formations. Absent further information, it is difficult to be sure.</p>', 1000);

The sense of the phrase is probably something like “*as we forgive them [the trespasses] for those [the trespassers] who trespass against us”.</p><p><b>Conceptual Development:</b> Earlier versions of the prayer (I-IV) used a different verb <i><a l="q" v="avatyar-"/></i> for “forgive”, as well as different prepositions for “so”: <i><a l="q" v="ier"/></i> (I-IIa) and <i><a l="q" v="ya">yan</a></i> (III-IV).

The literal meaning of this phrase in versions I-IV of the prayer seems to be “*as we forgive our trespassers”.</p><p>Tolkien considered a variety of ways to express “trespassers”. In version I-III, he used a (?verbal) element meaning “trespass” with the agental suffix <i><a l="q" v="-ndo"/></i>: <i>lucando</i> (I), <i><a l="q" v="lucindo"/></i> (IIa-IIb) and <i><a l="q" v="rocindo"/></i> (III), all meaning “trespasser” and all in the plural. In version IV, he used <i><a l="q" v="rohtalië"/></i> “trespass-people”, a compound of the noun <i><a l="q" v="rohta"/></i> “trespass” and <i><a l="q" v="lië"/></i> “people”.</p><p>These he combined with either the independent pronoun <i><a l="q" v="menya"/></i> “our” (I-IIb, IV) or the possessive suffix <i><a l="q" v="-mma²"/></i> “our” (I deletion, III). Finally, he used an ablative element meaning “from”, either the preposition <i><a l="q" v="va"/></i> (I-IIb) or the ablative suffix <i><a l="q" v="-llo"/></i> (I deletion, III-IV). There was a similar construction for the verb <i><a l="q" v="avatyar-"/></i> in <a l="q" v="ar ámen apsenë úcaremmar">line 6</a>.</p><p>In version V of the prayer, Tolkien corrected <i>úcarer</i> to <i>úcarir</i>. This second form is more consistent with the rules Tolkien followed elsewhere in forming the <a l="q" v="aorist"/> tense of a (basic) verb: it ends in an <i>-e</i> if unsuffixed but has an <i>-i-</i> between it and any suffix (<i>-r</i> in this case). However, Tolkien still used the form <i>úcarer</i> in version IV of the prayer, for reasons unknown.</p><center><table style="text-align: center"><tr><th>&#160;</th><th>&#160;&#160;I&#160;&#160;</th><th>IIa</th><th>IIb</th><th>III</th><th>IV</th><th>V</th><th>VI</th></tr><tr><td colspan="3">ier</td><td colspan="3">yan</td><td colspan="2">sív’</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8">emme</td></tr><tr><td>{avatyarirat &gt;&gt;}</td><td colspan="2">avatyarir ta</td><td colspan="3">avatyarilta</td><td colspan="2">apsenet</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">&#160;</td><td colspan="2">tien i</td></tr><tr><td>{lucandollommar &gt;&gt;}</td><td>va menya lucandor</td><td colspan="2">va menya lucindor</td><td>rocindillomman</td><td>menya rohtaliello</td><td colspan="2">úcarer emmen</td></tr></table></center><p>For better consistency with Tolkien’s other writings, I have used the more typical aorist form <i>úcarir</i> for the entry of this phrase.

It was from this meaning of the root that words with the connotation “holy” arose, at least in Quenya (PM/363).</p><p>Bill Welden instead connected S. <i>aer</i> “holy” with the word <i><a l="s" v="aerlinn"/></i> in the phrase <i><a l="s" v="Aerlinn in Edhil o Imladris"/></i> (RGEO/62). This phrase is untranslated, but it is widely believed that <i>aerlinn</i> means “*holy song” (VT44/24). Since <i>aer</i> cannot be lenited in <i>aerlinn</i>, this indicates that <i>aer</i> is the normal form of the word. In other writings, Tolkien derived Q. <i>airë</i> from primitive ✶<i><a l="p" v="airē"/></i> “holiness, sanctity” (PE17/149), which could also be the origin of S. <i>aer</i>. That is the theory used in this lexicon.</p><p>It is possible that this word appears in the name <i><a l="s" v="Aerandir"/></i>, but that is rather speculative.</p>', 1000);

There is also an Old English translation: “fif fota heah is se dura and þrie maeg samod þurghgangend”, in Modern English: “five foot high is the door and three may together through-go”.</p><p>The first part of the phrase is clear.

The third word is <i><a l="n" v="brann"/></i>, which is translated in the <i>Etymologies</i> as “lofty, noble, fine” (Ety/BARÁD) but here seems to mean “high”. The fourth word is the definited article <i><a l="n" v="i"/></i> “the” and the fifth is <i><a l="n" v="annon"/></i> “gate, door”. The sixth word <i>ar</i> is a variant of <i><a l="n" v="a"/></i> “and” (like its cognate ᴹQ. <i><a l="mq" v="ar"/></i>) followed by <i><a l="n" v="neledh"/></i> “three”.</p><p>The remainder of the phrase is difficult to interpret. The eighth word is illegible. Rhona Beare thought it might be ?<i>nelwhi</i> or ?<i>maohi</i> (VT07/7). Hammond and Scull rendered it as <i>neledhi</i>, which they interpreted as a variant of <i>neledh</i> “three”, so that <i>neledh neledhi</i> means “three by three”. Willis and Salo suggested instead that <i>neledhi</i> means “to walk [in]” (<a ref="PED-TAI"/>, <a ref="GS"/>/217), the infinitive of an unattested verb *<i><a l="n" v="neledh-"/></i> “to go in, enter” (<a ref="GS"/>/276). Willis further suggested that it was written over a rejected form <i>neledie</i> (also noted, but not interpretted, by Hammond and Scull), the Old Noldorin form of the word. Willis and Salo analyzed this verb as a combination of the prefix *<i><a l="n" v="ne-"/></i> “in” (also seen in N. <i><a l="n" v="nestag-"/></i> “stick in”) and a derivative of the root ᴹ√<i><a l="mp" v="LED"/></i> “go, fare, travel”. If the eighth word corresponds to English “walk [in]”, then this interpretation is quite plausible.</p><p>The ninth word <i>gar</i> seems to be a verb corresponding to English “may” in the sense “can, be able to”. Salo suggested that it is the Noldorin verb <i><a l="n" v="gar-"/></i>, but this is translated “hold, have” in the <i>Etymologies</i> (Ety/GAR), which does not seem appropriate. Willis suggested that is the (Early Noldorin?) verb ᴱN. <i><a l="en" v="gar"/></i> “went” seen in the phrase <i><a l="en" v="ven Sirion gar meilien"/></i> “towards (the river) Sirion went laughing”; Hammond and Scull also suggested it might be a verb meaning “go”. A third possibility is that it is a soft-mutation of the verb <i><a l="n" v="car-"/></i> “do, make” (Ety/KAR), perhaps lenited because it follows an infinitive form; the meaning of <i>car-</i> seems to me to be a bit closer in sense to “may”, but this is still just a guess.</p><p>The last word <i><a l="n" v="godrebh"/></i> might correspond to English “abreast”, but Hammond, Scull, Willis and Salo all suggested that it means “together through”, matching the Old English “samod þurgh”.
